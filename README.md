# Depop Python Interface
### By GithubAlt/hisoka

A word to those that want to use this. I was able to create this by running a wireshark sniffer on my iPhone and then just looking at the requests and replicating them in Python. You will have to sniff the traffic to get your client secret and ID. 

If you want any help I'm happy to provide it.
